   - Boundary conditions
   - Error scenarios

### Document Findings
- ‚úÖ What works as expected?
- ‚ùå What doesn't work?
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Any unexpected behavior?
- üêõ Any bugs discovered?

## Stage 4: Code Analysis (15 min)

For EACH changed file, analyze:

### A. Code Quality
- Is code readable and maintainable?
- Are variable/function names clear and descriptive?
- Are there complex functions that should be split?
- Is there code duplication (DRY violations)?
- Is the code properly commented where necessary?

### B. Logic & Correctness
- Does the logic make sense?
- Are there edge cases not handled?
- Could this fail in production?
- Are error messages helpful?
- Is there proper input validation?

### C. Performance
- Are there inefficient operations (nested loops, O(n¬≤))?
- Could this cause memory leaks?
- Are database queries optimized?
- Is there unnecessary re-rendering (React)?
- Are expensive operations properly memoized/cached?

### D. Security
- Is user input sanitized?
- Are there SQL injection risks?
- Are there XSS vulnerabilities?
- Are secrets properly managed (not hardcoded)?
- Is authentication/authorization properly implemented?

### E. Testing
- Are there unit tests for new functionality?
- Do tests cover edge cases?
- Are integration tests needed?
- Is test coverage adequate (aim for 80%+)?
- Are tests isolated and deterministic?

### F. Documentation
- Is the code self-documenting?
- Are complex algorithms explained?
- Is README updated if needed?
- Are API changes documented?
- Are breaking changes clearly marked?

## Stage 5: Architecture & Design

### Evaluate
- Does this follow existing patterns in the codebase?
- Is the solution scalable?
- Are there better alternative approaches?
- Does this introduce technical debt?
- Is the abstraction level appropriate?
